This project adds mobile responsiveness and media queries into the travel-fly project. Thankfully, my experience with web development has meant that I did not have to restructure must of the existing content in order to make it work well in terms of creating a responsive design. The part that gave me the most trouble was truthfully the navigation, as I had to decide just exactly how it was that I wanted to create the nav. As I have been learning some javascript in N220, I decided to put that to use with a basic hide/show function. The hamburger menu is extremely common on mobile devices, and so I wanted to carry that over.
